## I have a problem

I want to be a software engineer, but to do that, I need to get a job
with the title of "software engineer", instead of developer.

I need that validation because I can't rely on my own perception and judgement.
To do that, I need to reinfoce the current knowledge I have and learn new things
that I never got the change to learn.

## My detailed plan

I need to cover three areas: technical skills, soft skills, and branding.

### Technical Skills

I know how to do frontend views but I still need to master that because I still have to
learn how to apply semantic html and user-centered styles. I still don't know how to
set up backend services. If I want to get a better job, I need to become a full stack
engineer that will open up new opertunities or make me a better frontend engineer.

I will learn a lot of things and hopefully share what I learn. This may not be the most 
important thing to do because I already know to do things, I just need to polish it.

### Soft Skills

The hability to talk to people and to sell that I'm an engineer. This is the most important one
becuase If I'm not a good communicator or listener, my technical skills won't be useful.

I need to reach my network and improve my communication skills, don't be so shy, I'm going to
be more active on my social networks.

### Branding

I need to become known as someone who is a software engineer or aspires to be one, that's why
I'm going to start doing blogs and videos about what I learn or know. This is something that will
complement the other two areas.
