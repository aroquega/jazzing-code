## My Goal

I want to be a software engineer. I thinkn I'm still not at that level yet.
What I want is to get a job with a high salary (~100k a year) for a country
in America or Canada.

I need to learn and update the required skills to be able to do that. I think
I'm in the middle of the road to get there. I mainly need to work on my soft
skills.

I also want to rely on the process rathen than the goal. I know that getting
a job won't make me happier. Why then do I want it? because a goal gives me
a direction, it's compass I'll use so that I cannot get lost in the journey.

I'll get a job with a good foundation on software engineer and habits
that will make me a software engineer.

## My detailed plan

I need to cover three areas: technical skills, soft skills, and branding.

### Technical Skills

I know how to do develop frontend applications with React and I worked with many other
software tools so I think I have a pretty good base. Nevertheless, there are holes in my
knowledge that I need to fill and important skills I need learm. For example:

1. Accesibilityword wra
2. Semantic html
3. User-centered Design
4. I18N
5. Next.js

I also need to learn backend development because this will give a better understanding of
the frontend and more flexibility at the time of choosing jobs.

Besides that, I think I still have holes in concepts that are really important like:

1. Algorithms
2. Software Architecture
3. User Experience
4. Software Systems (ERPs)

I don't think I'm starting from the ground up, but I need to polish some things and learn
new ones. How will I know when I'm ready? I'll set up from key metrics with a more structured
plan of the topics/themes but the most important of one will be the skill of explaining and
talking about them, leveragin my soft skills.

### Soft Skills

The hability to talk to people and to sell that I'm an engineer. This is the most important one
because If I'm not a good communicator or listener, my technical skills won't matter.

I need to imcrease my network and improve my communication skills, don't be so shy, I'm going to
be more active on my social media and try to express the values I stand by without being
so explicit.

The will be the hardest part because I'm shy and awkward, I don't speak with clarity and I tend
to stutter, but this will give a great advantage over other people.

### Branding

I want to be known as a software enginner, a subject matter expert when it comes to technology and developing software. That's why it's importante to brand myself as one.

This will also give me the opportunity to show my technical and social skills. I will be doing
videos and blogs about software engineering, software development and technology.

## Final Words

I'm getting ready for a journey that will fulfill my career. Maybe it's
a little vague, but I don't want to be bounded as "web developer" or a "mobile developer". I know that to find a job I will need to focus on a topic, right now I'm focusing on web, but after that I plan to work on mobile development too, and keep learning, with the foundation of software engineering, everything it's possible.

I want to be clear that this will be last post where I'm going to talking about myself and what I want, I may update this post in the future, but I want to provide value and people aren't not really interested in what I want or desire. The following posts will be more about software engineering, and if you've read this post, thank you üòÅ
